Hello, my name is Axel Cortes and I am a junior at UTRGV. My favorite hobbie is to play and watch soccer. The only thing that I need to survive would be a TV to watch the soccer games. 
The World Cup starts this Sunday, November 20 and I am really excited. Other than soccer I also enjoy playing videogames and coding.
